--------

cwallet is a CLI that allows you to generate an asymmetric key pair and encode
the public key as a Bitcoin wallet address.

The number of different cryptographic processes used in a bitcoin wallet is
immense. Most notably is the elliptic curve algorithm and hash functions that
are used.

./cwallet.py : to generate a private key

./cwallet.py [private key] : to generate a bitcoin address from a private key
